# Grow Cabin — One-Page Project Brief (v0)

_Last updated: 2026-02-11_

## 1) What it is
Grow Cabin is a controlled-environment home growing system focused on **repeatable mushroom and greens harvests** using simple recipes (setpoints + schedules) rather than trial-and-error.

## 2) Who it is for (initial)
- Primary: home growers who want reliable outcomes with low daily effort.
- Early wedge: mushroom-first users who value consistency and contamination-risk reduction.

## 3) Problem
Home growing often fails because climate control is inconsistent:
- humidity and airflow are hard to balance,
- contamination and mold events are common,
- outcomes vary too much between runs,
- setup/monitoring burden is too high for most people.

## 4) Value proposition
**“Grow Cabin gives you repeatable harvests through recipe-driven environment control.”**

Core promise:
- predictable climate bands,
- clear stage-based guidance,
- telemetry logs for support and iteration,
- lower cognitive load than DIY setups.

## 5) v0 product shape
- Sensors: temp/RH minimum; optional CO2/light depending on tier.
- Actuators: fan (FAE), humidifier, lights (greens path).
- Control: rules + hysteresis first; stage scheduling next.
- Logging: timestamped sensor/actuator events tied to recipe version.

## 6) Commercial shape (current hypothesis)
- **v0 go-to-market bias:** controls-first offer (customer-provided enclosure) before full shed bundle.
- Price framing (provisional):
  - Essential controls tier: ~£599–£699
  - Enhanced controls tier: ~£899–£1,099
- Rationale: faster launch, lower logistics complexity, faster learning loops.

## 7) Success metrics (first phase)
- time-to-harvest consistency,
- yield per tray/block,
- failure/contamination rate,
- minutes/day of user effort,
- running cost (kWh/water).

## 8) Key risks
- support burden if component quality is inconsistent,
- contamination blame boundary with third-party inputs,
- unclear segment fit if value narrative is too broad,
- hardware reliability and safety/compliance overhead.

## 9) Next milestone (30–60 days)
- lock initial crop path,
- lock MVP sensor/actuator stack,
- run structured user interviews + design-partner tests,
- produce investor proof pack with KPI evidence and cost baseline.

## 10) Open decisions
- first mushroom species,
- greens format (microgreens vs baby leaf),
- final v0 pricing posture (affordable vs premium prosumer),
- local-first vs cloud-first product behavior.
