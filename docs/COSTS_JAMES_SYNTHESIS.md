- `notes/inbound/james-bundle-2026-02-10/research/budget-grow-sheds.md`

## 1) Core cost anchors extracted

### Enclosure build (8×6 insulated shed)
- **Budget build (EPS + OSB + felt): ~£923**
- **Better build (PIR + featheredge + onduline): ~£1,332**

### Environmental control package
- **Essential package components: ~£210.50**
- **Enhanced package components: ~£332.00**

### Estimated productized environmental package (incl. assembly/pack/ship)
- **Essential product cost: ~£275**
- **Enhanced product cost: ~£417**

### Suggested retail guide (from source, to be validated)
- **Essential kit: £599–£699**
- **Enhanced kit: £899–£1,099**

## 2) Combined system scenarios (shed + controls)

- **Budget shed + Essential controls:** ~£1,198 (923 + 275)
- **Budget shed + Enhanced controls:** ~£1,340 (923 + 417)
- **Better shed + Essential controls:** ~£1,607 (1,332 + 275)
- **Better shed + Enhanced controls:** ~£1,749 (1,332 + 417)

These are useful **BOM + fulfilment baselines** for investor and pricing discussions.

## 3) Design implications for Grow Cabin

1. **PIR walls/roof materially simplify humidity management** due to foil-faced vapour barrier behavior.
2. **Essential control tier is price-attractive** and aligns with mushroom-first wedge.
3. **Enhanced tier is a clear upsell path** for mixed mushrooms + microgreens and app/automation narrative.
4. **Support boundary must be explicit** when using marketplace-sourced components (especially humidifiers/sensors).

## 4) Immediate integration tasks

- [ ] Merge baseline rows into `docs/COSTS_MOCKUP.csv` with `source=james-bundle` tags
- [ ] Add supplier confidence column (retail availability/reliability)
- [ ] Add v0 target price bands in `docs/COSTS.md` (prototype vs first-batch)
- [ ] Tie tier choice to card `gc-005` (target price band) and `gc-006` (MVP stack)

## 5) Caveats

- Costs are indicative and time-sensitive; re-quote before commitments.
- Retail pricing assumptions need test against support burden, returns, and VAT handling.
- Electrical/humidity safety compliance requirements are not yet fully costed.
