# Grow Cabin — Segmentation test plan (Foodie + Wellness, mushrooms-first)

**Goal:** pick the initial segment + v0 mushroom wedge based on real signals, not vibes.

This is deliberately lightweight: 10 conversations, 3 cards, fixed script, simple scoring.

## Decisions already made
- Segments to test first: **Foodie** + **Wellness/Functional**
- Wedge: **Mushrooms-first**

## Output we want (end of test)
1) Winning segment (Foodie vs Wellness)
2) First v0 species direction (default hypothesis: **oyster for reliability**; test appetite for **lion’s mane**)
3) Price-band hypothesis (from willingness-to-pay signals)
4) Top 3 objections + how we address them

---

## Step 1 — Prepare 3 “positioning cards” (A/B/C)
Make these as plain text notes or a simple image. The objective is clarity and comparability.

### Card A — Foodie: “Chef-at-home mushrooms”
- Fresh mushrooms that actually taste good (not sad supermarket ones)
- Predictable harvests (humidity + airflow handled)
- Beautiful on a plate; learn one signature recipe
**Price anchor:** Device £___ + optional £__/mo recipes/support
**Proof later:** harvest + plated dish photos

### Card B — Wellness: “Consistency + routine”
- A reliable grow routine (less guesswork, fewer failed tubs)
- Guided recipes (what to do each stage)
- Track grows so you can repeat wins
**Price anchor:** Device £___ + optional £__/mo recipes/support
**Proof later:** “X successful cycles” + a simple log/graph

### Card C — Hybrid sanity-check: “Foodie-first, wellness-capable”
- Optimised for taste-first mushrooms, but supports lion’s mane recipes too
- One device, multiple species recipes over time
- Upgrade path: more recipes, better automation
**Price anchor:** same

---

## Step 2 — Recruit 10 people
- 5 Foodie-types (cook, host, care about ingredients)
- 5 Wellness-types (gym/health optimisers, supplement buyers)

Aim for 10–15 minutes each.

---

## Step 3 — Fixed interview script (don’t freestyle)
Ask in this order:
1) Which card is most interesting immediately?
2) What do you think this costs?
3) At what price is it: **too cheap to trust / good value / too expensive**?
4) What would stop you buying?
5) What would “success after 30 days” look like?

**Rule:** don’t pitch or defend. Capture exact words.

---

## Step 4 — Scoring rubric (0–3 each)
Score each card per person:
- **Excitement:** 0 none / 1 mild / 2 strong / 3 “I want this”
- **Clarity:** 0 confused / 1 some / 2 clear / 3 instantly gets it
- **Willingness to pay:** 0 no / 1 maybe / 2 yes / 3 yes + price volunteered
- **Urgency:** 0 someday / 1 this year / 2 soon / 3 now

Sum totals by segment. Winner should be obvious.

## Step 5 — Turn results into product choices
Once the winner is clear:
- Confirm v0 species (start oyster if optimising for early success rate/testimonials)
- Confirm isolation tier (1/2/3)
- Confirm MVP sensors/actuators required
- Confirm price-band target + subscription packaging

## Notes (claims discipline)
For Wellness: sell **reliability + freshness + convenience**, avoid medical claims.
