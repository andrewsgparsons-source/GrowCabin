# UK Partner Scoring Rubric (v0)

_Last updated: 2026-02-11_

Purpose: consistently score partner/supplier candidates for Grow Cabin reference-kit selection.

## 1) Scoring scale
Use 1–5 per criterion:
- 1 = poor / high risk
- 3 = acceptable
- 5 = strong / low risk

## 2) Criteria and weights

| Criterion | Weight | What good looks like |
|---|---:|---|
| UK availability reliability | 20% | Stable stock, predictable lead times |
| Physical compatibility | 15% | Dimensions/interfaces fit v0 constraints |
| Performance consistency | 20% | Repeatable behavior across batches |
| Support boundary clarity | 15% | Clear fault ownership and warranty boundaries |
| Price/value | 15% | Competitive and sustainable for kit economics |
| Integration potential | 15% | Bundle/referral/wholesale/API possibilities |

## 3) Weighted score formula
`Total = Σ(score_i * weight_i)` (normalize to 100)

## 4) Decision thresholds
- **80–100**: reference-kit candidate (strong)
- **65–79**: watchlist / pilot candidate
- **<65**: reject for v0

## 5) Required notes per scored partner
- Key risks and mitigations
- Minimum order / account constraints
- SKU-level caveats (batch variance, returns profile)
- Last checked date and evidence links

## 6) Suggested process
1. Fill template row in `PARTNER_SHORTLIST_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Score with this rubric
3. Rank top 5 by category
4. Select 1–2 reference kits for v0 trials
