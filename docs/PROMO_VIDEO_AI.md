# Grow Cabin — Promo video (AI tools) research

Goal: a **high-quality, mind-blowing** promotional video for Grow Cabin with minimal cost and minimal complexity.

## What we need to decide first (inputs)
- **Video type:**
  1) Product render / concept film (looks premium, less "real")
  2) Real prototype footage + AI polish (most credible)
  3) Hybrid (best: real footage + AI shots for “future” moments)
- **Length:** 15s / 30s / 60–90s
- **Channel:** website hero, TikTok/IG, YouTube, investor deck

## Recommended approach (likely best ROI)
### Phase 1 — Real footage + AI polishing (fast, believable)
- Shoot phone footage: unboxing, door open, mist, shelves, simple UI mock
- Use AI tools for:
  - background cleanup
  - camera shake smoothing
  - captions + voiceover
  - music + sound design

### Phase 2 — Add 2–3 “wow” shots with AI video generation
- Use AI video gen for:
  - cinematic product hero shot
  - environment “inside the cabin” visualisations
  - time-lapse style growth shot (stylised)

## Tool categories to research
1) **AI video generation** (text/image→video)
2) **AI editing** (cuts, pacing, auto-b-roll)
3) **AI voiceover**
4) **AI music**
5) **Product mockups** (Figma/3D/Blender/Babylon renders)

## Cost model (what we’ll estimate)
- subscription per month
- per-minute generation cost
- total spend to produce 1 strong 30–60s video

## What “mind-blowing” usually means
- tight script (benefit-driven)
- good lighting/footage OR convincing renders
- sound design
- rapid iteration (5–10 versions)

## Next actions
- [ ] Research 5–10 best current stacks and price them (UK)
- [ ] Recommend 2 stacks: **lean** and **premium**
- [ ] Draft a 30s script + shot list for Grow Cabin
