# Grow Cabin — Organisational structure

This is a lightweight operating model for an early-stage startup (1–3 people) that keeps ownership clear without bureaucracy.

## Functions (what must exist)
Even if one person holds multiple roles:

1) **Product** — roadmap, decisions, recipes concept, customer outcomes
2) **Engineering (HW/SW)** — prototypes, reliability, data logging/control
3) **Go-to-market** — segmentation, messaging, website, growth
4) **Operations** — suppliers, costs, shipping assumptions, support
5) **Finance/Admin** — budgets, runway, pricing, compliance

## Early roles (suggested)
- **Founder/CEO (Andrew)**: product vision, customer discovery, partnerships, fundraising
- **Builder/CTO-ish**: prototype execution (hardware + firmware + app), instrumentation, iteration loop
- **GTM (part-time)**: positioning tests, content, website, design partners

## Cadence (weekly)
- 30–45 min weekly review:
  - decisions made
  - experiments run + outcomes
  - current blockers
  - next 5 priorities

## Artifacts (single source of truth)
- Kanban board
- Decision map
- Roadmap
- Docs (briefings, stakeholders, pricing)

## Next actions
- [ ] Confirm who owns each function for the next 4 weeks
- [ ] Set the weekly review time
