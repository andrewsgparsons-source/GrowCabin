# Grow Cabin — v0 Target Price Band Framing

_Last updated: 2026-02-11_

Goal: choose a realistic v0 customer price band anchored to current cost baselines.

## 1) Cost anchors (from current synthesis)

- Budget shed + Essential controls: **~£1,198**
- Budget shed + Enhanced controls: **~£1,340**
- Better shed + Essential controls: **~£1,607**
- Better shed + Enhanced controls: **~£1,749**

(See `docs/COSTS_JAMES_SYNTHESIS.md`.)

## 2) Candidate commercial offers

### Offer A — Controls kit only (no shed)
- Customer provides/owns enclosure.
- Candidate price band: **£599–£1,099** depending on Essential vs Enhanced tier.
- Best for: faster launch, lower logistics risk.

### Offer B — Full system bundle (shed + controls)
- Candidate price band: **£2,199–£3,499** depending on build tier and warranty/support package.
- Best for: strongest “done-for-you” value, but harder operations.

### Offer C — Phased upsell
- Start with Offer A, add add-ons (lighting, watering, smarter controller), then move to Offer B once reliability and install process are repeatable.

## 3) Recommendation (provisional)

For v0, prioritize **Offer A (controls-first)** with two tiers:
- **Essential:** target headline band around **£599–£699**
- **Enhanced:** target headline band around **£899–£1,099**

Reasoning:
1. Lower complexity than shipping full sheds.
2. Fits current cost model and existing notes.
3. Faster iteration with design partners and cleaner support boundaries.

## 4) Decision needed from Andrew

- Do we optimize v0 for **controls kit** first, or jump to **full system bundle**?
- Preferred initial market posture:
  - **Affordable:** drive volume + learning
  - **Premium prosumer:** higher margin, lower volume

## 5) Next actions

- [ ] Tie this to `gc-005` (price band), `gc-006` (MVP stack), and investor proof pack.
- [ ] Add prototype vs first-batch unit economics table (support/returns assumptions).
- [ ] Validate willingness-to-pay with interview script outputs.
