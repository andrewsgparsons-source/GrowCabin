# Briefing prompt — delta (since last family briefing)

Copy/paste this into ChatGPT to produce the next ~800 word family briefing update.

---

You are an expert startup communicator.

Write an **~800 word** briefing aimed at **mom & pop family members and older kids/teens**.

Tone: warm, clear, practical, not hypey. Avoid jargon unless you define it in plain English. Use short sections with headings and bullets.

### Context
We’re building **Grow Cabin**, a controlled-environment growing system to help people reliably grow **mushrooms** and **spring greens** using **recipes** and **logging** so results are repeatable.

### Output structure (must use)
- Title
- “In one sentence”
- “The problem we’re solving”
- “Our solution”
- “What we’ve built/decided so far”
- “What’s new since the last briefing”
- “What we’re deciding next”
- “What happens in the next 4–8 weeks”
- “How you can help”

### DELTA INPUT (new work since last briefing)
- We created a public **Grow Cabin dashboard website** (GitHub Pages) and continuously expanded it into a full operating system: Kanban, decision map, brain/mind-map, rules, docs.
- We added a **Docs** section inside the dashboard so all documentation is readable directly on mobile/desktop.
- We upgraded the UI (v2 template) with sidebar navigation, and added a **scrollable sidebar**.
- We added new dashboard pages: **Marketing** (with clickable/expandable sections), **Stakeholders**, **Briefings**, **Org structure**, **Investors**, **Startup setup (UK)**, **Costs** (now renders cost tables inline), **Product & Process Dev** (now selectable sections), **Product design**, **Business model**, **Partners**.
- We built and published two cost models:
  - a **mock range-model** BOM CSV
  - a **James BOM extracted** CSV (from an inbound research bundle)
  Both are viewable as tables on the Costs page and exportable to CSV.
- We expanded the **Investor** work: investor route flow, an investor pack checklist, and a dedicated Investors page that links to costs and stakeholders.
- We added a **UK startup setup** checklist page (Companies House/Ltd vs sole trader, name/trademark checks, banking/accounting, insurance/compliance) and started a tracked research task to deepen it.
- We introduced a **partners/integration strategy**: partnering with existing mushroom and microgreens kits/suppliers to speed up v0; created a Partners page and a research task to scan UK offerings.
- We updated the **Org structure** to include named roles and label AI roles consistently:
  - Nicki (Founder)
  - Andrew (Founder/CEO)
  - Andy (Operations & strategy coordinator — AI)
  - James (Chief design & systems engineer — AI)
  - Harry (Product integrity technician)
  - Chloe (Chief taster)
- We updated the **Brain** map to include the new functional areas (marketing, investors, costs, startup setup, partners, etc.) so everything links together.

### Constraints
- Around 800 words (±10%).
- Make it easy to skim.
- Be honest about what’s still early and undecided.

Now write the briefing.
