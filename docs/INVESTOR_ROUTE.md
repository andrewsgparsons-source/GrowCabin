# Grow Cabin — route to first investor (draft)

This is the current working flow for *how we get to a first investor yes*.

## Flow (end-to-end)

### 0) Start
**Start → Define investor target**

### 1) Who is the first investor?
Pick one primary lane:
- **A. Angels / friends-of-friends** (fastest if you have warm intros)
- **B. Pre-seed micro-VC** (needs a clearer narrative + stronger traction)
- **C. Strategic** (needs domain fit + credible prototype)

### 2) What proof does that investor require?
Choose the minimum proof level:
- **Concept proof:** problem, solution, why now, why us
- **Prototype proof:** working demo showing control + repeatability
- **Market proof:** LOIs / paid pilots / waitlist / early revenue

### 3) Build the minimum proof package (v0)
**Core artifacts**
- 1-page narrative: **Grow Cabin = recipes + repeatable harvests at home**
- Decision log: crop focus, isolation tier, one vs two chambers
- Prototype evidence: telemetry + setpoint control (RH + FAE; lighting for greens)
- Evidence/KPIs (simple table):
  - days-to-harvest
  - yield per tray / block
  - contamination / failure rate
  - time spent (minutes/day)
  - running cost (kWh / water)

### 4) Validate demand cheaply
- Landing page + email capture
- 10–20 customer interviews
- 5–10 design partners who agree to test prototypes
- Optional: small preorder/deposit (only once confident in delivery)

### 5) Package the investor story (lean deck)
- Problem → why existing home growing fails (time, inconsistency, mold)
- Solution → CEA + recipes + logging + explainable automation
- Market → home grow now; prosumer/schools/restaurants later (optional)
- Moat → recipes + data + workflow + community + iteration speed
- Roadmap → what next 3 milestones are
- The ask → amount + what it funds + runway

### 6) Outreach + close loop
- Build target list (e.g., 30), aim for 10 meetings
- Warm intros first
- Track objections; iterate narrative weekly

### End
**First investor commits → convert funding into milestone execution**

## Decision gates investors will ask about
- Crop focus (mushrooms vs greens vs dual)
- One chamber vs two variants
- Isolation tier (1/2/3)
- Price band + BOM plausibility
- Local-first vs cloud features

## Open questions to tailor the plan
- Is the first investor more likely **angel** or **pre-seed**?
- Are we raising **pre-revenue** (prototype + waitlist) or **post-revenue** (paid testers)?

## Execution checklist
- See `docs/INVESTOR_PROOF_PACK_CHECKLIST.md` for a concrete proof-pack checklist and raise-readiness exit criteria.
