## 1. Growing Environment Requirements

### Mushroom Growing (Fruiting Stage)

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Temperature | 10–24°C (species-dependent; oysters 15–21°C, shiitake 12–18°C) |
| Humidity | 80–95% RH (critical — must be maintained constantly) |
| Fresh air exchange (FAE) | 4–8 air changes per hour (CO₂ must stay below 800–1000 ppm) |
| Light | Low/indirect — 12hrs dim light for pinning, not direct sunlight |
| Cleanliness | Surfaces must be easy to clean; no exposed wood ideally |

**Key insight from GroCycle (UK mushroom farm educators):**
- A 5m² fruiting room is enough to start commercially
- Incubation stage needs ~20–24°C, dark, warm space
- Fruiting stage needs fresh air, humidity, and a little light
- DIY options: hydroponics grow tent, wood-frame + plastic sheeting, insulated shed, shipping container
- 30m² total space (mixing + incubation + fruiting) can produce up to 50kg/week
- 10kg/week requires ~10–15 hours of work

### Microgreen Growing

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Temperature | 18–24°C (consistent) |
| Humidity | 40–60% RH (moderate — not as demanding as mushrooms) |
| Light | Strong — LED grow lights on shelving, 12–16hrs/day |
| Ventilation | Good airflow to prevent mould, 2–4 air changes/hour |
| Water | Misting/bottom watering |

### Insulation R-Values Needed

To maintain 15–20°C inside when it's 0–5°C outside (typical UK winter):

| Component | Minimum R-Value | Recommended R-Value |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Walls | R-1.5 (m²K/W) | R-2.0–2.5 |
| Roof | R-2.0 | R-2.5–3.0 |
| Floor | R-1.0 | R-1.5–2.0 |

**Translation to insulation thickness:**
- **EPS 70** (λ=0.038): 50mm = R-1.3, 75mm = R-2.0, 100mm = R-2.6
- **PIR** (λ=0.022): 50mm = R-2.3, 75mm = R-3.4, 100mm = R-4.5
- **Mineral wool** (λ=0.035): 50mm = R-1.4, 75mm = R-2.1, 100mm = R-2.9

**Recommendation:** 50mm PIR or 75mm EPS minimum for walls; 75mm PIR or 100mm EPS for roof.

## 2. Framing Timber

### CLS Timber (Smooth, C16 graded, kiln-dried)

| Product | Supplier | Price (inc VAT) | Per Metre |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| CLS 38×63mm × 2400mm | **Wickes** | **£3.75** | **£1.56/m** ✅ CHEAPEST |
| CLS 38×63mm × 2400mm | Screwfix | £4.15 (or 6 for £22 = £3.67) | £1.73/m |
| CLS 38×63mm × 3000mm | Wickes | £5.15 | £1.72/m |
| CLS 38×89mm × 2400mm | **Wickes** | **£6.90** | **£2.88/m** ✅ CHEAPEST |
| CLS 38×89mm × 3000mm | Wickes | £8.75 | £2.92/m |

**URLs:**
- Wickes CLS range: https://www.wickes.co.uk/search?text=CLS+timber
- Screwfix CLS 38×63: https://www.screwfix.com/p/essentials-cls-timber-38mm-x-63mm-x-2400mm/982je

**Notes:**
- Screwfix bulk deal: 6× CLS 38×63×2400 for £22 = £3.67 each — slightly cheaper than Wickes in bulk
- For a shed this size, **38×63mm CLS is sufficient** for stud walls
- Use 38×89mm for sole plates and any load-bearing elements
- **Travis Perkins / Selco:** Typically 10–20% cheaper for trade accounts; call for quotes on treated sawn timber which is cheaper than CLS
- **Sawn treated timber** (rough cut, cheaper alternative): typically £1.00–1.30/m for 47×50mm from timber merchants — worth checking locally

### Budget tip
Untreated sawn timber from local sawmills can be 30–50% cheaper than CLS. For an indoor growing environment where timber is protected by insulation and cladding, untreated is fine for the frame. Only floor/sole plates need treatment.

## 3. Sheet Materials

### OSB3 Boards (Moisture-resistant, structural)

| Product | Supplier | Price (inc VAT) | Per m² |
|---------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| OSB3 9mm 2400×1200mm | **Wickes** | **£20** | **£6.94/m²** ✅ CHEAPEST |
| OSB3 11mm 2440×1220mm | Wickes | £22 | £7.38/m² |
| OSB3 18mm 2440×1220mm | Wickes | £23 | £7.72/m² |
| OSB3 9mm 606×1829mm (handy panel) | Wickes | £17.60 | £15.88/m² |

**URLs:**
- Wickes OSB range: https://www.wickes.co.uk/search?text=OSB+sheet
- Sheet Materials Wholesale (trade prices, delivery): https://www.sheetmaterialswholesale.co.uk (call for OSB3 quotes: 0203 856 8578)

**Notes:**
- **OSB3** is moisture-resistant — important for grow shed with high humidity
- 9mm OSB3 is fine for wall sheathing/lining
- 11mm for floors, 18mm for heavy-duty floors or roof decking
- Sheet Materials Wholesale typically cheaper for 10+ sheets — call for pallet pricing
- **Selco** (trade only): Usually £1–3 cheaper per sheet than Wickes; need trade card

### Chipboard (NOT recommended for mushroom growing — moisture will destroy it)

### Structural Plywood
- 12mm softwood ply: ~£22–28 per sheet (8×4) at Wickes/Screwfix
- More expensive than OSB3 but slightly better moisture performance
- **For mushroom grow sheds: OSB3 is the best value moisture-resistant option**

### PIR Boards (Better performance per mm, but more expensive)

| Product | Supplier | Price (inc VAT) | R-Value | Per m² |
|---------|----------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Kingspan TP10 50mm 2400×1200mm | **Wickes** | **£35** | 2.27 m²K/W | £12.15/m² |

| Kingspan TW50 100mm 1200×450mm | Wickes | £15 | — | £27.78/m² |

**URL:** https://www.wickes.co.uk/search?text=PIR+insulation+board

### Mineral Wool (Cheapest but not ideal for high-humidity environments)
- Absorbs moisture unless fully sealed behind vapour barrier
- **NOT recommended for mushroom growing** without excellent vapour sealing
- Budget option: ~£4–6/m² for 50mm from Screwfix

### Insulation Recommendation for Grow Sheds

**Budget option (mushrooms):** 
- Walls: 50mm EPS 70 + vapour barrier (R-1.3) — adequate with supplementary heating
- Roof: 75mm EPS 70 (R-2.0)
- Floor: 50mm EPS 70 on DPM

**Better option:**
- Walls: 50mm PIR (R-2.3) — foil-faced = built-in vapour barrier
- Roof: 50mm PIR (R-2.3)
- Floor: 50mm EPS on DPM

**PIR is ideal for mushroom growing** because:
- Foil face acts as vapour barrier (critical at 80–95% humidity)
- Closed-cell = won't absorb moisture
- Better R-value per mm = thinner walls = more internal space
- Tape joints with foil tape for airtight vapour seal

## 5. Cladding

### Featheredge (Overlap) Boards — Traditional shed cladding

| Product | Supplier | Price (inc VAT) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Featheredge 150×11mm × 1.8m | **Wickes** | **£3.50** | Treated softwood |
| Featheredge 100×11mm × 1.8m | Wickes | £2.50 | Narrower |
| Featheredge 100×11mm × 1.5m | Wickes | £2.20 | Short lengths |
| Featheredge 150×11mm × 2.4m | Wickes | £5.00 | Full height |
| Featheredge 100×11mm × 2.4m | Wickes | £3.20 | — |

**URL:** https://www.wickes.co.uk/search?text=featheredge+board

**Coverage calculation (8×6 shed):**
- Perimeter: ~2×(2440+1830) = 8540mm
- Height: ~2100mm (eaves)
- Wall area: ~18m²
- At 150mm boards with 25mm overlap = ~125mm effective width
- Need ~68 boards × 2.4m @ £5.00 = **~£340** for featheredge cladding

### Sheet Cladding Alternative (MUCH CHEAPER)
- **OSB3 9mm** as exterior cladding + exterior paint/stain
- 6 sheets of OSB3 9mm @ £20 = **£120** + £30 exterior paint = **£150 total**
- Not as pretty but half the cost and faster to install
- Must be well painted/treated for weather protection

### Corrugated Sheet Cladding
- Can also use corrugated bitumen or PVC sheets as wall cladding
- Very weather-resistant, low maintenance
- ~£15/sheet × 6 sheets = £90 for walls

## 6. Roofing

### Cheapest Options

| Product | Supplier | Price (inc VAT) | Coverage |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Shed felt (black) 10m×1m** | **Screwfix** | **£27.99** | 10m² |
| Shed felt (green) 10m×1m | Screwfix | £27.99 | 10m² |
| IKO Black Shed Felt 10×1m | Wickes | £28 | 10m² |
| IKO Super Shed Felt 8×1m | Wickes | £45 | 8m² |
| Onduline Onduvilla Roof Kit (8×6) | Wickes | £165 | Full 8×6 roof |
| Corrugated bitumen sheets | Screwfix | ~£15/sheet | ~1.9m² each |

**URLs:**
- Screwfix felt: https://www.screwfix.com/search?search=shed+roofing+felt
- Wickes felt: https://www.wickes.co.uk/search?text=roofing+felt
- Wickes Onduline kits: https://www.wickes.co.uk/search?text=corrugated+roofing+sheet

**For 8×6 shed roof (~5m²):**
- **Cheapest:** Shed felt — £28 for 10m roll (plenty for 8×6 + overlap)
- **Better:** Corrugated bitumen (Onduline) — ~3 sheets × £15 = £45 (longer lasting)
- **Premium:** Onduvilla kit — £165 (complete system, looks good, long warranty)

**Recommendation:** Corrugated bitumen is best value-for-longevity. Shed felt is cheapest but needs replacing every 5–8 years. For a permanent grow shed, spend the extra £17 on Onduline sheets.

## 7. Vapour Control

### Critical for mushroom growing at 80–95% humidity!

| Product | Supplier | Price (inc VAT) | Coverage |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **DPM 1000ga 4m×3m** | **Screwfix** | **£12.19** | 12m² |
| DPM 1000ga 15m×4m | Screwfix | £35.99 | 60m² |
| DPM 1000ga 25m×4m | Screwfix | £55.99 | 100m² |
| DPM 1200ga 15m×4m | Screwfix | £44.99 | 60m² |
| General sheeting 150ga 25m×4m | Screwfix | £17.99 | 100m² |

**URL:** https://www.screwfix.com/search?search=DPM+polythene+250

### Vapour Barrier Strategy for Grow Sheds

**Mushroom shed (high humidity inside):**
The vapour barrier goes on the WARM/WET SIDE — which is the INSIDE of the shed.

Build-up (outside to inside):
1. External cladding (OSB/featheredge)
2. Breather membrane (allows moisture out)
3. Timber frame with insulation between studs
4. **Vapour barrier / DPM** (prevents moisture entering insulation)
5. Internal lining (washable — painted OSB, plastic sheeting, or FRP panels)

**If using PIR insulation:** The foil faces largely act as a vapour barrier — tape all joints with aluminium foil tape for a sealed envelope. This is the simplest and most effective approach.

**If using EPS:** You MUST add a separate vapour barrier (DPM sheet) on the warm side.

**Budget option:** Damplas DPM 1000ga 4×3m — £12.19 per piece. Need 2–3 pieces for an 8×6 shed walls + ceiling = ~£36.

| **DIY approach** | — | Insulated timber shed (this research) | **£500–900** |

**Key finding:** No UK company appears to sell a purpose-built "mushroom growing shed" as a flat-pack product. This is either:
- Done with grow tents (cheapest, least durable)
- DIY insulated sheds (this research — best value)
- Shipping container conversions (expensive, commercial scale)
- Converted existing spaces (garages, basements)

**Market opportunity?** A flat-pack insulated grow shed at £800–1200 could fill a gap.

## 11. Design Recommendations

### For Mushroom Growing Shed

1. **Use PIR insulation** — foil faces provide vapour barrier, closed-cell won't absorb moisture
2. **Internal lining:** Painted OSB3 (or line with FRP/plastic sheeting for easy cleaning)
3. **Seal everything:** Foil tape all PIR joints, seal around penetrations
4. **Separate zones if possible:** Incubation area (warm, dark, 20–24°C) and fruiting area (cooler, humid, ventilated)
5. **Drainage:** Slope floor slightly to a drain point — water will accumulate
6. **Electrics:** Waterproof fittings (IP65); RCD protected circuit
7. **Shelving:** Metro-style wire shelving (allows airflow) — ~£50–80 for a 4-tier unit
8. **Fresh air:** Ducted intake low, exhaust high — creates natural convection pattern

### For Microgreen Growing Shed

1. **EPS insulation is fine** — lower humidity means less vapour risk
2. **Invest in lighting:** LED grow lights are the main expense — £40–100 for strip setups
3. **Shelving is key:** Multi-tier growing maximises small space — 4–5 tiers of growing trays
4. **Ventilation:** Simple extract fan + passive intake is sufficient
5. **Water-resistant flooring:** OSB3 floor with waterproof coating or vinyl on top

### Dual-Use Shed (Best of Both)

An 8×6 shed can be divided:
- **4×6 mushroom fruiting room** (insulated, sealed, humidified)
- **4×6 microgreen growing room** (insulated, lit, ventilated)
- Shared wall with different environmental controls each side
- This maximises the footprint and allows two income streams

## Summary

| Build Option | Total Cost | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Budget** (EPS + OSB cladding + felt) | **~£920** | Functional, needs painting/maintenance |
| **Better** (PIR + featheredge + Onduline) | **~£1,330** | More durable, better vapour control |
| **Grow tent alternative** | **£150–300** | Cheap start, not durable, not insulated |

**Bottom line:** For under £1,000 you can build a properly insulated 8×6 growing shed. The key cost drivers are insulation type (EPS vs PIR) and cladding (sheet vs board). PIR is worth the premium for mushroom growing due to built-in vapour resistance.

**Compared to buying a standard 8×6 shed (£500–800) and trying to insulate it afterward**, a purpose-built insulated shed is similar cost but performs significantly better because the insulation is integral to the wall construction.
