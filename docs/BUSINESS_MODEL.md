# Business model development

## Core idea
Sell a grow system *plus* an optional ongoing service (subscription) that improves success rates and retention.

## Revenue streams (candidate)
1) **Hardware sale** (cabinet or shed package)
2) **Consumables** (filters, replacement parts, blocks/kits partnerships)
3) **Subscription service** (recipes, monitoring, support)
4) **Premium support / installation** (especially for shed)

## Subscription: what is the service?
Possible subscription tiers:
- **Basic**: recipe library + reminders + troubleshooting
- **Plus**: advanced analytics + “what happened?” explanations
- **Pro**: remote support (with consent) + alerts + best-practice tuning

## Why subscription is valuable
- Higher grow success → happier customers → more referrals
- Predictable revenue
- A place to deliver continuous improvements (recipes)

## Flow diagram (draft)

```

## Key business model decisions
- What value is *free* vs *paid*?
- Local-first vs cloud features (privacy/resilience)
- Liability boundaries: what do we promise vs what is guidance?
