# Product design — insulation + vapor control

## Why it matters
Mushrooms need **80–95% RH**; insulation and vapour control prevent condensation, rot, and heat loss.

## Candidate approaches
- EPS vs PIR insulation (PIR often better in high humidity due to foil-faced vapour barrier)
- Tape joints, seal penetrations

## Next actions
- Define Tier 1/2 insulation spec for the shed build
