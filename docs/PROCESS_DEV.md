# Process development (how we build)

## Cadence
- Weekly review (30–45 min): decisions, experiments, blockers, next 5 priorities
- Daily check-in (5 min) during active prototyping

## Decision discipline
Each decision gets:
- options
- rationale
- what would change our mind
- owner + date

## Experiment loop
Hypothesis → experiment → measure → decision
- Keep experiments small (5–10 units, not 100)
- Log outcomes in a consistent template

## Documentation discipline
- Kanban = what we’re doing
- Decision map = why we chose a path
- Costs = numbers
- Briefings = reusable narratives
