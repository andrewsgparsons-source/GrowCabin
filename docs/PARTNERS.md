# Grow Cabin — Partners & integrations

Idea: reduce time-to-market and operational risk by partnering with existing kit/input suppliers, and designing Grow Cabin around a small number of **reference kits**.

## Partner modes
### 1) Inputs partner (recommended first)
We sell the Grow Cabin environment + recipes; we officially support specific third-party inputs.
- Mushrooms: fruiting blocks / spawn kits
- Greens: microgreens kits / seeds / tray systems

Benefits:
- Faster v0 (use proven inputs)
- Clear onboarding (“use kit X with recipe Y”)
- Lower contamination blame (if boundaries are clear)

Risks/requirements:
- Must standardise physical interface (tray/block sizes)
- Need recipe profiles per partner kit
- Support boundaries need to be explicit

### 2) Co-branded bundles
Grow Cabin + partner kits sold together.

Benefits:
- Higher AOV
- Better conversion

Risks:
- Inventory/ops complexity
- Shared support + returns

## What we must standardise (interfaces)
- Physical sizes + racking spacing
- Water handling + drainage
- Environmental profiles (RH/FAE/temp/light)
- Consumables cadence (replacement blocks/trays)

## Research backlog (UK focus)
- Mushroom kits + block suppliers
- Microgreens kits + seed/media suppliers
- Grow lighting (LED bars/panels) suitable for shelves
- Environmental controllers geared to mushrooms/greens (humidity, CO₂, FAE)

## Next actions
- [x] Build first-pass UK shortlist draft (infrastructure + control stack) — see `docs/PARTNERS_UK_SHORTLIST_V0.md`
- [ ] Expand to full UK shortlist (10–20) including mushroom kits/blocks, microgreens kits, lights, and controllers
- [ ] Pick 1–2 reference kits for v0 design constraints
- [ ] Draft a partner pitch email (we increase repeat purchases via recipes + reliability)
