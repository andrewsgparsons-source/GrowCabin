# Grow Cabin — Marketing

This section is the "go-to-market" workspace: research → positioning → channels → website → conversion → partnerships.

## 1) Market research
- Market map: home growers, prosumers, education, chefs, wellness, DIY kits
- Competitor scan: grow tents, mushroom monotubs, countertop hydroponics, smart indoor gardens
- Customer interviews: script + notes + scoring rubric
- Key pains to validate:
  - inconsistency / mold / contamination
  - time/effort to manage humidity + airflow
  - space + aesthetics (home acceptance)
  - repeatable harvest timing

## 2) Market strategy
- Pick the **initial segment** (see Decision Map: Segmentation)
- Define the wedge offer:
  - Chamber device vs kits vs recipes subscription vs starter bundle
- Define messaging pillars:
  - "set the recipe"
  - "repeatable harvests"
  - "clean + controllable"

## 3) Website development
- Landing page (single page) with:
  - hero value prop
  - 3 benefits
  - proof (prototype photos/telemetry)
  - waitlist capture
  - FAQ (mold, smell, power use, cleaning)
- Analytics: basic event tracking (signup, CTA clicks)

## 4) Business development
- Potential partners:
  - mushroom spawn/block suppliers
  - microgreens seed suppliers
  - community groups / schools
- Early distribution options:
  - direct-to-consumer
  - local retailers (garden/health/foodie)

## 5) Cost basis + pricing strategy
- Decide target price band (v0)
- Build a BOM estimate (rough classes first)
- Unit economics:
  - gross margin target
  - shipping + returns
  - support costs

## 6) Content & community
- "Recipe" content:
  - species recipe pages
  - greens recipe pages
  - troubleshooting
- Community loop:
  - invite design partners
  - share results + recipes

## 7) Sales funnel & conversion
- Waitlist → design partner → paid tester → referrals
- KPI targets:
  - waitlist conversion rate
  - time-to-first-harvest
  - success rate (no mold/contamination)
