# Grow Cabin — Partner shortlist template (UK)

Purpose: build a UK shortlist of inputs + components we can design around as **reference kits**.

## How to use
Create one row per candidate partner/product and fill fields consistently.

## Template fields
- **Category:** mushroom blocks/kits | spawn | microgreens seeds/media | trays/racks | grow lights | humidifiers | fans/ducting | filters | sensors/controllers
- **Brand / Supplier name:**
- **Product(s):**
- **UK availability:** (yes/no; lead time)
- **Price range:** £
- **Physical interface constraints:** size, tray/block dimensions, fittings
- **Quality / trust signals:** reviews, pro usage, warranty
- **Recipe implications:** RH/FAE/temp/light assumptions
- **Support boundary risk:** what can fail that we’d get blamed for?
- **Integration opportunity:** co-branded bundle | referral/affiliate | wholesale | API/controller integration
- **Notes:**
- **Link(s):**

## Reference kit criteria (for v0)
A reference kit should be:
- reliably available in the UK
- consistent physical dimensions
- consistent performance (repeatability)
- simple to explain (“use kit X + recipe Y”)
- low support ambiguity (clear boundaries)
