Andrew Parsons, [11/02/2026 15:15] Grow Cabin – Project Delta Briefing (Audio Version) This briefing focuses only on what has changed since the last update. In one sentence: We have moved from concept coordination into structured system definition — formalising control loops, recipe architecture, prototype stack decisions, cost bands, partner scoring, and investor proof framing — while building a working parametric prototype model and tightening execution. Pause. Here is the executive delta. We defined the environmental control architecture across P0, P1 and P2. Instrumentation, humidity control, fresh air exchange scheduling, lighting, and watering now each have dedicated design documents. We formalised contamination and cleanability principles as core design constraints, not afterthoughts. We created a structured recipe schema, version zero, defining stage-based control abstraction. We introduced decision matrices for species selection, greens format, chamber architecture, and isolation tier. These major structural decisions are now active and in progress. We defined the MVP stack and evaluated component options for the first small prototype. We synthesised inbound cost research into a structured cost document and created early pricing bands. We built structured investor artifacts, including a proof pack checklist and a one-page brief. We developed a UK partner shortlist and scoring rubric to accelerate version zero. We drafted a 30-second promotional script and shot list. We launched an interactive Babylon.js parametric prototype model page, with configurable options and x-ray mode. And we improved navigation by adding a top-level dashboard page with exit-to-dashboard controls across the system. Pause. The key shift is this: We now have artifacts driving decisions, instead of ideas driving conversation. Pause. Kanban movement. Fourteen major cards moved into in-progress. These include species decision, greens format decision, one versus two chamber decision, isolation tier decision, prototype zero runbook, humidity loop design, fresh air exchange scheduling design, lighting strategy, watering strategy, contamination principles, brand naming form, and promo script. Additional cards continue progressing in costs synthesis, investor proof pack, partner strategy, architecture definition, recipe abstraction, pricing bands, and MVP stack. Signal: Strategic decisions are now being actively resolved rather than parked. Pause. Decision maturity update. Species selection: current recommendation is to focus on one or two resilient culinary species, likely oyster dominant. Confidence medium. Missing evidence: contamination data and full grow cycle validation. Greens format: recommendation is microgreens over baby leaf for version zero. Confidence medium. Missing evidence: margin modelling and watering reliability testing. Architecture: leaning toward single chamber modular first. Confidence medium. Missing evidence: airflow modelling and contamination cross-risk data. Isolation tier: mid-tier sealed but not lab-grade. Confidence medium. Missing evidence: mold failure rate testing. Pricing posture: mid-market, not cheapest. Confidence medium. Missing evidence: cost sensitivity and competitor benchmarking. Naming form: functional compound naming structure. Confidence low to medium. Missing evidence: real market feedback. Pause. Prototype progression. P0 instrumentation is now defined. We have sensor expectations, logging philosophy, and a runbook structure. Still vague: exact sensor models, calibration workflow, and long-term data storage. Shift: observability now has structure. Pause. P1 environmental control. Humidity loop logic is conceptually defined. Fresh air exchange scheduling tradeoffs are documented. Still unresolved: tuning constants, lag behaviour, geometry dependency. Shift: control logic exists on paper but not yet validated physically. Pause. P2 greens subsystem. Lighting abstraction is defined. Watering options are evaluated. Contamination interactions are considered.Andrew Parsons, [11/02/2026 15:15] Still open: tray standardisation, drainage design, power and heat implications. Shift: greens is now a defined subsystem, not an add-on. Pause. Risks introduced by recent changes. One: over-formalisation before empirical data. Mitigation: tie every document to a prototype validation step. Two: decision fatigue from parallel workstreams. Mitigation: sequence species, architecture, and isolation first. Three: premature architecture lock-in. Mitigation: keep MVP stack modular. Four: pricing anchoring too early. Mitigation: avoid external communication of pricing bands. Five: underestimating contamination dynamics. Mitigation: run early contamination stress tests. Six: promotional narrative ahead of proof. Mitigation: frame promo as prototype journey. Seven: partner dependency risk. Mitigation: maintain internal fallback capability. Pause. Decisions Andrew needs to make next. One: single-species version zero, yes or no? Two: commit to single chamber for version zero, yes or no? Three: accept mid-tier isolation and iterate, or overbuild early? Four: launch mushrooms-only first, or mushrooms plus greens? Five: commit to mid-market pricing posture now, or defer? These decisions compress ambiguity. Pause. Next seven actions. One: finalise species decision and lock primary species. Two: run contamination stress simulation tied to cleanability principles. Three: validate humidity loop assumptions with a simple chamber test. Four: reduce MVP stack to a single concrete configuration. Five: perform cost sensitivity sweep across core components. Six: tighten isolation tier scoring with failure modelling. Seven: rewrite the one-page brief once structural decisions are locked. Pause. Overall posture. System definition has accelerated. Architecture is clearer. Control logic is framed. Costs are grounded. What is missing now is physical validation and forced decisions. We are no longer ideating. We are narrowing. End of briefing.
