# Grow Cabin — Family briefing update (2026-02-10 19:13 UK)

**Keywords:** update, dashboard, costs, investors, UK setup, partners, org structure

## In one sentence
Grow Cabin is a home growing system that helps people reliably grow mushrooms and spring greens by using clear “recipes” and simple logging, so good results can be repeated instead of guessed at.

## The problem we’re solving
Lots of people try to grow food at home and give up. Not because they don’t care, but because the environment is hard to control.

Common issues:
- Too much or too little humidity, especially for mushrooms
- Poor airflow, leading to mold or stalled growth
- Inconsistent results — one good harvest, then failure
- No clear record of what worked, so mistakes get repeated

## Our solution
Grow Cabin is a controlled growing “cabin” paired with a simple operating system:
- Recipes
- Logging
- Explainable actions

## What we’ve built / decided so far
We now have a public **dashboard website** that acts like a central operating system:
- Kanban
- Decision map
- Brain/mind map
- Rules + Docs

All documentation is readable on mobile/desktop.

## What’s new since the last briefing
### New dashboard sections
Marketing, Stakeholders, Briefings, Org structure, Investors, Startup setup (UK), Costs, Product & process development, Product design, Business model, Partners.

### Costs (early but real)
Two cost models:
- Mock range-based BOM
- Extracted BOM from an inbound research bundle

Both are viewable as tables on the dashboard and exportable to CSV.

### Investor groundwork
- Investor route flow
- Investor pack checklist
- Investors page linking costs + stakeholders + decisions

### UK startup setup
Checklist covering:
- Ltd vs sole trader
- Name/trademark checks
- Banking/accounting
- Insurance/compliance

### Partners and integrations
Plan to partner with existing mushroom/microgreens kit suppliers to speed v0.

### Team clarity
Nicki — Founder
Andrew — Founder / CEO
Andy — Operations & strategy coordinator (AI)
James — Chief design & systems engineer (AI)
Harry — Product integrity technician
Chloe — Chief taster

## What we’re deciding next
- Exact v0 product shape
- How “smart” v0 should be
- Which partners to work with first
- Whether mushrooms or greens lead

## What happens in the next 4–8 weeks
- Deepen UK startup setup research
- Shortlist partner kits/suppliers
- Refine 1–2 recipes end-to-end
- Tighten cost models with real assumptions
- Define v0 (what it is and isn’t)

## How you can help
- Ask awkward questions (especially “who is this really for?”)
- Share the dashboard with a sensible person
- Flag anything confusing/overcomplicated
- Gentle introductions (food growing, hardware, retail)
