# Product design — overview

This is where we describe the product at a system level (physical + controls + app/service).

## Scope
- The **cabinet/chamber** concept (countertop/indoor)
- The **shed** concept (larger insulated grow shed)
- Environmental control system (humidity + FAE + temp + light)
- Racking/shelving systems
- App + backend support model

## Design goals
- Reliability: repeatable harvests
- Cleanability: contamination-resistant surfaces, no hidden damp cavities
- Quiet + home-friendly
- Modular: expand from “simple” to “smart” tiers
