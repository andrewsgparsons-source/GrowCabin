# Product design — app + backend support

## App goals
- Monitor: current conditions + last 24h graph
- Control: select recipe, stage, and setpoints (within safe bounds)
- Explain: "what I’m doing and why"
- Support: troubleshooting guided by logs

## Backend support model (optional)
- With user consent, we can:
  - view telemetry
  - flag issues early
  - help tune recipes

## Privacy + reliability
- Local-first operation
- Cloud optional and additive
