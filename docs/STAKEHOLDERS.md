# Grow Cabin — Stakeholders

A single view of the humans/orgs that matter, and what we need from each.

## Investors
**Goal:** funding + credibility + introductions.

### Investor lanes (likely order)
- **Angels** (fastest): warm intros, practical feedback, lighter process.
- **Pre-seed micro-VC**: expects clearer narrative + early traction + a plan.
- **Strategic**: expects strong domain fit + prototype evidence.

### What we want from the first investor
- Enough cash to hit the next 1–2 milestones (prototype + design partners)
- Introductions (suppliers, design partners, operators)
- A sanity-check on segment + pricing + distribution

### What they will ask (so we pre-answer)
- Who is the initial customer segment and why?
- Why will Grow Cabin win vs DIY + existing indoor grow products?
- What proof do you have that people will pay?
- What’s the MVP, timeline, and cost?
- What are the main risks (mold/contamination, reliability, safety) and mitigations?
- How does this become a real business (distribution + unit economics)?

### Investor pack (what we should have ready)
**1) Story / deck (8–12 slides)**
- Problem
- Solution
- Product (what it is + what’s unique: recipes + repeatable harvests)
- Why now
- Market + initial segment
- Go-to-market (first channel)
- Traction (or validation plan)
- Unit economics (rough)
- Roadmap + milestones
- Team
- The ask (amount + what it funds)

**2) One-pager (PDF)**
- The simplest version of the story + numbers.

**3) Demo assets**
- Photos/video of prototype
- Short screen capture of telemetry/logging + recipe controls

**4) Evidence appendix (optional but strong)**
- Customer interview notes (anonymised)
- Waitlist metrics
- KPI table: success rate, days-to-harvest, time spent, running cost

**5) Cost & pricing model**
- BOM range (v0)
- Assembly + shipping + returns assumptions
- Target retail price and expected margin band

### Slide-by-slide storyboard (skeleton)
1. **Title** — Grow Cabin: repeatable home harvests (mushrooms + greens)
2. **Problem** — home growing fails due to control (humidity/airflow/light), mold, inconsistency
3. **Why now** — components cheaper, consumer interest, “recipes” + logging unlock repeatability
4. **Solution** — controllable CEA chamber with recipes + logging + explainable automation
5. **Product** — what it physically is + key features (RH/FAE, lights; local-first)
6. **Customer / segment** — pick one initial segment (foodies / wellness / DIY / education)
7. **Go-to-market** — initial channel + how we acquire design partners
8. **Traction / validation** — what we’ve learned, what we’re testing next (positioning cards → 10 interviews → micro-prototypes)
9. **Economics** — target price band, BOM range, margin story
10. **Roadmap** — milestones over next 8 weeks / 6 months
11. **Team** — founders + key roles
12. **The ask** — £X for Y months to deliver milestones A/B/C

### Next actions
- [ ] Decide the initial investor lane (angel vs pre-seed) and target ask
- [ ] Convert storyboard into a draft deck (Google Slides)
- [ ] Assemble the evidence appendix (KPIs + photos + interview notes)

## Customers
**Goal:** design partners → paid testers → repeat customers.

- Candidate segments (initial):
  - Chefs/foodies
  - Wellness/functional
  - DIY/home kits
  - Families/education
- What we need:
  - interviews
  - willingness-to-pay signals
  - successful grows + testimonials

## Suppliers
**Goal:** reliable inputs, consistent quality, and potential co-marketing.

- Mushroom inputs:
  - spawn / fruiting blocks
  - substrates
  - filters / consumables
- Greens inputs:
  - seeds
  - trays/media
- Hardware:
  - sensors, fans, humidification components, LEDs

## Notes / next actions
- [ ] Create an initial stakeholder list (names + contact + status)
- [ ] Track asks + next step + owner per stakeholder
