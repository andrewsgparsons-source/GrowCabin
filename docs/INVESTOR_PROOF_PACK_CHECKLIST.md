## A) Narrative (must-have)
- [ ] One-line thesis: **"Grow Cabin delivers repeatable home harvests via controlled environment + recipes."**
- [ ] Problem statement with concrete pains (inconsistency, contamination, time burden)
- [ ] Why now (consumer interest + CEA cost curve + climate/supply concerns)
- [ ] Why us (speed, recipe model, practical build/cost realism)

## B) Product proof (must-have)
- [ ] Working demo (environment control loop actually running)
- [ ] Stage-based recipe model drafted and tested at least once
- [ ] Basic telemetry log (temp/RH + actuator events)
- [ ] Failure handling documented (sensor dropout, over-humidity, fan failure)

## C) Evidence KPIs (must-have)
- [ ] Days-to-harvest (by crop type)
- [ ] Yield per tray/block
- [ ] Failure/contamination rate
- [ ] Minutes/day user effort
