# Product design — shed/enclosure

## Enclosure variants
- **Indoor cabinet/chamber**: smaller footprint, home aesthetic
- **Insulated grow shed** (8×6 baseline): more capacity, better for serious growers

## Materials + cleanability
- Avoid exposed wood in high humidity zones (or fully seal)
- Prioritise wipe-clean surfaces

## Airtightness + access
- Door seals/gaskets
- Cable glands
- Duct penetrations

## Next questions
- Do we want to sell the shed as a product, or treat it as a “premium installation” variant?
