# Grow Cabin — Briefings

A place for short, reusable briefs you can send to stakeholders (investors, suppliers, customers, partners).

## 1) One-paragraph briefing
**Grow Cabin** is a controlled-environment grow “cabin” for home growers to reliably produce mushrooms and spring greens using recipes (setpoints + schedules) with logging and automation.

## 2) One-page briefing (outline)
- Problem (inconsistency, mold/contamination, effort)
- Solution (CEA + recipes + repeatable harvests)
- Why now (indoor growing interest, component costs, community)
- What’s unique (recipes + logs + explainable automation)
- MVP scope
- Roadmap milestones
- Ask (design partners / funding / suppliers)

## 3) Briefing templates
### Investor intro (email-sized)
- 2 lines: what it is + who it’s for
- 1 line: traction/proof so far
- 1 line: ask + why them

### Supplier outreach
- what we’re building
- what we need (specs/quantities)
- why it’s interesting (repeat purchases, co-marketing)

### Design partner invite
- what you’ll do (test recipe + provide feedback)
- what you get (early access, discounted unit, influence)
