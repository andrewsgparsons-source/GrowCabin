## Milestone 0 — Decisions (1–2 weeks)
- Choose mushroom species for v0
- Choose greens format (microgreens vs baby leaf; tray size)
- Decide one chamber vs two variants
- Choose isolation tier (1/2/3)
- Decide target price band

## Milestone 1 — Prototype 0: instrument + learn (2–4 weeks)
- Sensor logging (temp/RH, door; optional light)
- Manual control with clear observations
- Start capturing KPIs: failure modes, condensation, contamination patterns

## Milestone 2 — Prototype 1: closed-loop basics (4–8 weeks)
- Humidity control loop + safeguards
- FAE scheduling
- Greens light schedule (if included)
- Recipe v0 implementation (stages + setpoints + versioning)

## Milestone 3 — Design partners (parallel)
- 10–20 interviews
- 5–10 design partners
- Landing page + waitlist

## Milestone 4 — Investor package
- 1-page brief + lean deck
- Proof package: demo + KPI table + photos/videos
