# Grow Cabin — UK startup setup (checklist + research)

**Purpose:** a practical checklist for setting up Grow Cabin in the UK (legal, admin, banking, accounting), plus initial cost estimates.

> Note: this is not legal/tax advice. We should sanity-check with an accountant/solicitor once we decide the approach.

## 1) What legal structure should we use?
Common UK options:
- **Sole trader** (fastest/cheapest to start; personal liability)
- **Partnership** (shared; still personal liability)
- **Private limited company (Ltd)** (most common for startups; limits liability; easier for investment)

**Typical startup default:** a UK **Ltd** if we expect investors, want separation of liability, and may hire/contract.

## 2) Do we register with Companies House?
If we choose **Ltd**, yes.

Key choices:
- company name
- registered office address
- directors + shareholders
- share structure (e.g., ordinary shares; later you may use an option scheme)

## 3) Name checks: can we use “Grow Cabin”?
We should check:
- **Companies House name availability** (exact/similar)
- **UK trademark search** (UKIPO)
- **domain + handles** (\*.com / social)

Important: name being available at Companies House does **not** guarantee trademark safety.

## 4) Founders + equity basics (early)
- Who are the founders (Nicki, Andrew) and ownership split?
- Vesting (common with investors)
- IP assignment (ensure the company owns the work)

## 5) Banking: business bank account
- For an **Ltd**, get a dedicated business account.
- Consider: fees, cash deposits, card controls, accounting integrations.

## 6) Accounting + bookkeeping
- Choose accounting software (Xero / QuickBooks / FreeAgent)
- Set up chart of accounts (basic)
- Track receipts from day 1
- Decide how you’ll pay founders (salary vs dividends later; ask accountant)

## 7) HMRC + taxes
- Corporation Tax (Ltd)
- PAYE (if paying salaries)
- VAT registration (if/when thresholds or beneficial)

## 8) Insurance (don’t skip)
Likely relevant:
- Public liability
- Product liability (hardware)
- Employers’ liability (if hiring)
- Professional indemnity (if giving advice; depends)

## 9) Compliance: hardware + consumer
If we sell a device in the UK, likely considerations include:
- Electrical safety (UKCA/CE aspects)
- EMC (interference)
- Consumer rights, warranties/returns
- Product documentation and safety warnings

## 10) Food-related considerations
We’re enabling production of food at home. We should be careful about:
- how we describe outcomes
- any “health claims” (especially if medicinal mushrooms are mentioned)

## 11) Data/privacy (if we log data)
If we collect customer data:
- basic GDPR compliance
- privacy policy and retention

## 12) Setup cost estimate (initial rough)
**Minimum (lean, basic):** ~£200–£1,000
- Companies House incorporation
- basic domain/email
- accounting software
- basic insurance (varies)

**More realistic (serious early-stage):** ~£1,000–£5,000
- proper legal templates (founder docs, IP assignment)
- branding assets
- initial compliance planning

**Higher (if we do compliance testing early):** £5,000+
- lab tests (EMC, safety) can dominate if done early

## Next actions
- [ ] Decide structure (sole trader vs Ltd)
- [ ] Run name checks (“Grow Cabin”) across Companies House + UKIPO trademarks
- [ ] Decide banking + accounting stack
- [ ] Draft founder docs checklist (vesting, IP assignment)
- [ ] Create a line-item setup cost model (CSV)
