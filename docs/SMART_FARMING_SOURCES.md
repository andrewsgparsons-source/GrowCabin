# Smart Farming Sources (Curated Starter Set)

_Last updated: 2026-02-11_

Purpose: build a high-quality reference base for Grow Cabin strategy (taxonomy, standards/interoperability, MRV, practical market framing).

## High-confidence sources added this heartbeat

1. **FAO e-Agriculture community** (UN/FAO)
   - Link: https://www.fao.org/e-agriculture/
   - Why it matters: clear institutional framing of digital agriculture/ICT adoption in agriculture and rural development.
   - Use in project: baseline definitions + policy context.

2. **AGROVOC Multilingual Thesaurus** (FAO)
   - Link: https://agrovoc.fao.org/browse/agrovoc/en/
   - Why it matters: controlled vocabulary for agriculture concepts.
   - Use in project: normalize terminology in glossary/taxonomy (avoid synonym drift).

3. **OGC SensorThings API Standard** (Open Geospatial Consortium)
   - Link: https://www.ogc.org/standards/sensorthings/
   - Why it matters: open standard for sensing + tasking data models in IoT systems.
   - Use in project: interoperability model for sensor/event pipelines and future API design.

4. **ISOBUS Data Dictionary (ISO 11783 family reference implementation)**
   - Link: https://www.isobus.net/isobus/
   - Why it matters: machinery data semantics used in precision agriculture ecosystems.
   - Use in project: map Grow Cabin telemetry vocabulary against established ag data naming conventions where practical.

5. **EU ETS MRV overview** (European Commission)
   - Link: https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-markets/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets/monitoring-reporting-and-verification_en
   - Why it matters: practical, regulator-facing explanation of MRV cycles and compliance discipline.
   - Use in project: structure any future sustainability claim reporting and auditability model.

6. **IBM Smart Farming explainer** (major vendor perspective)
   - Link: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smart-farming
   - Why it matters: mainstream enterprise framing + adoption drivers.
   - Use in project: market narrative benchmark (biased source; use with caution).

## Working notes

- Priority next: add 4–8 peer-reviewed review papers (irrigation optimization, CEA control, PLF sensing, remote sensing for yield/health).
- Also add at least 2 UK/EU university-extension style references for implementation realism.
- Web fetch limitations observed on some sites (Cloudflare/403/redirect loops); use Windows Chrome relay browsing path for blocked targets when needed.
