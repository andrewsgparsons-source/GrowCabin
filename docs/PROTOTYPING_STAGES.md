# Prototyping stages

## Prototype 0 — instrument + learn
- sensors + logging
- manual control
- goal: understand dynamics + failure modes
- runbook: `docs/PROTOTYPE_0_INSTRUMENTATION_RUNBOOK.md`

## Prototype 1 — closed-loop basics
- humidity control loop (+ safeguards against condensation/over-wetting)
- scheduled FAE
- recipe v0 (stages + versioning)
- humidity loop design doc: `docs/PROTOTYPE_1_HUMIDITY_LOOP_DESIGN.md`

## Prototype 2 — greens automation
- lighting schedule + (optional) dimming
- watering automation
- refined onboarding + troubleshooting
