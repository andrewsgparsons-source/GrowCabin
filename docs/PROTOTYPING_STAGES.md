# Prototyping stages

## Prototype 0 — instrument + learn
- sensors + logging
- manual control
- goal: understand dynamics + failure modes

## Prototype 1 — closed-loop basics
- humidity control loop (+ safeguards against condensation/over-wetting)
- scheduled FAE
- recipe v0 (stages + versioning)

## Prototype 2 — greens automation
- lighting schedule + (optional) dimming
- watering automation
- refined onboarding + troubleshooting
