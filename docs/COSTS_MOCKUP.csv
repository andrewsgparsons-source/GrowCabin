Enclosure (plastic/metal cabinet),Mechanical,1,25,120,25,120,"Depends on size, materials, insulation, aesthetic finish"
Door + gasket/seals,Mechanical,1,5,25,5,25,"Tier 2+ better sealing; affects humidity stability"
Shelving/tray rails,Mechanical,1,5,30,5,30,"Supports trays/blocks; removable for cleaning"
Fasteners/adhesives/consumables,Mechanical,1,2,15,2,15,"Screws, clips, silicone, tape"

Temp+RH sensor,Electronics,1,2,12,2,12,"At least one; consider 2 for gradient detection"
CO2 sensor (optional),Electronics,1,15,60,15,60,"Optional v0; useful for mushrooms / FAE tuning"
Light sensor (optional),Electronics,1,1,10,1,10,"Optional; helps verify lighting consistency"
Door/open sensor,Electronics,1,0.5,5,0.5,5,"Reed switch or hall sensor"
Water level sensor (optional),Electronics,1,1,8,1,8,"If humidifier reservoir is automated/monitored"

Controller (MCU / SBC),Electronics,1,4,60,4,60,"MCU cheaper; SBC enables richer UI but higher cost"
Power supply,Electronics,1,6,25,6,25,"Appropriate wattage; safety-certified preferred"
Wiring + connectors + terminals,Electronics,1,4,25,4,25,"Harnessing, strain relief"

Fan(s) for fresh air exchange,Actuation,1,5,35,5,35,"Size/noise matters for home users"
Air ducting + vents,Actuation,1,2,20,2,20,"Intake/exhaust path; reduce drafts"
Filter(s) (optional),Actuation,1,3,20,3,20,"Helps hygiene; replacement consumable"
Humidifier module (ultrasonic),Actuation,1,8,45,8,45,"Integrated vs off-the-shelf base"
Heater (optional),Actuation,1,8,40,8,40,"If room temps vary; safety interlocks needed"
Dehumidification strategy (fan/exhaust),Actuation,1,0,0,0,0,"Often achieved via ventilation; dedicated dehumidifier increases BOM"

LED grow light panel/strip (greens),Actuation,1,10,80,10,80,"Driver + mounting; dimming adds complexity"
Pump/valve + tubing (watering, optional),Actuation,1,8,60,8,60,"For greens; may be Prototype 2"

User interface (buttons/LEDs),UX,1,1,20,1,20,"Local controls; app/web optional"
Display (optional),UX,1,8,60,8,60,"Nice-to-have; increases BOM and design effort"

Assembly labour (internal estimate),Ops,1,15,120,15,120,"Mock placeholder: depends on build time + rate"
Test & calibration time,Ops,1,5,60,5,60,"Sensor sanity checks, burn-in, QA"
Packaging,Ops,1,3,25,3,25,"Box, inserts, manuals"
Shipping (average),Ops,1,8,35,8,35,"Highly variable by size/weight/region"
Returns allowance (per unit),Ops,1,3,25,3,25,"Expected returns/warranty buffer"

Total (excl. optional upgrades),,1,0,0,0,0,"Sum in spreadsheet; treat as range model"
