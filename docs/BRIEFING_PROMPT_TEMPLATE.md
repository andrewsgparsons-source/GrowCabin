# Briefing prompt — template (standard)

Use this to generate a new briefing whenever we complete a significant body of work.

## How to use
1) Copy the prompt below into ChatGPT.
2) Replace the **DELTA INPUT** section with bullet points describing what changed since the last briefing.
3) Keep the audience and length the same unless we explicitly change them.

## PROMPT (copy/paste)

You are an expert startup communicator.

Write an **~800 word** briefing aimed at **mom & pop family members and older kids/teens**.

Tone: warm, clear, practical, not hypey. Avoid jargon unless you define it in plain English. Use short sections with headings and bullets.

### Context (do not change)
We’re building **Grow Cabin**, a home/near-home “controlled environment agriculture” (CEA) growing system that helps people reliably grow **mushrooms** and **spring greens** using **recipes** (setpoints + schedules) and **logging** (tracking sensor readings and actions) so results are repeatable.

### Output structure (must use)
- Title
- “In one sentence”
- “The problem we’re solving”
- “Our solution”
- “What we’ve built/decided so far”
- “What’s new since the last briefing”
- “What we’re deciding next”
- “What happens in the next 4–8 weeks”
- “How you can help”

### Constraints
- Around 800 words (±10%).
- Make it easy to skim.
- Use confident but honest language (no overpromising).

### DELTA INPUT (replace this block each time)
- [Add bullet points describing new work since last briefing]

### Must include (if relevant to delta)
- Any new decisions added
- Any new pages/docs created
- Any new costs/pricing work
- Any new investor-pack progress
- Any new partner/market research direction

Now write the briefing.
